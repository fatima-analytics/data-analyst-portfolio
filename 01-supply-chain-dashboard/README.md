# Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

## 🎯 Business Context
The primary objective of this project is to enhance operational efficiency within the supply chain. The analysis focuses on two key pillars:
1. **Lead Time Reduction**: Minimizing the gap between the order date and the actual delivery date.
2. **Profit Optimization**: Analyzing and maximizing the profit margin per item sold.

Key performance indicators developed for this dashboard include:
* **Total Sales**: Global revenue sum.
* **Total Profit**: Total net margin realized.
* **Total Orders**: Total volume of processed orders.
* **Late Delivery Rate**: Percentage of orders delivered past the promised date.
* **Suspected Fraud Count**: Identification of high-risk transactions.
* **Shipping Analysis**: Monitoring dispatch dates to identify logistical bottlenecks.

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning (Power Query)
Rigorous data transformation was performed to ensure logistics data integrity:
* **Data Type Management**: Standardizing date formats to calculate shipping durations.
* **Handling Missing Values**: Cleaning or imputing incomplete delivery records.
* **Data Standardization**: Harmonizing product names and shipping categories.
* **Lead Time Calculation**: Creating custom columns to measure the variance between ordering and fulfillment.
