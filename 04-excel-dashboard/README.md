# Excel Sales Dashboard

## 🎯 Business Context
The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance across different time dimensions (annual and monthly). The dashboard focuses on identifying top-performing products and analyzing customer behavior to optimize inventory and sales strategies.

## 📊 KPIs
I implemented the following metrics to track business health:
* **Total Sales**: Overall revenue generated.
* **Total Quantity**: Total units sold across all categories.
* **Orders Count**: Total number of transactions processed.
* **Average Quantity per Order**: Measuring the typical basket size.
* **Median Quantity**: To understand the central tendency of order volumes without outlier influence.
* **Most Sold Product**: Identification of top-selling items by volume and revenue.

## 🛠️ Excel Techniques & Data Cleaning
This dashboard leverages advanced Excel features for data processing and visualization:
* **Power Query**: Used for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to clean raw data and handle date formatting.
* **XLOOKUP & Advanced Formulas**: Utilized to merge datasets and create dynamic calculations.
* **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts**: The core engine used to aggregate data for monthly and annual trends.
* **Dynamic Slicers**: Implemented to allow users to filter by "Customer Performance" and "Product Category."
* **Data Validation**: Ensured data integrity by preventing entry errors in the source tables.

## 🚀 Tools Used
* **Microsoft Excel** (Advanced)
* **Power Query for Excel**
